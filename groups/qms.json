    "description": "This blueprint helps streamline your quality management processes by centralising how issues are raised, tracked, and resolved. It includes templates and workflows for managing deviations, non-conformances (NCRs), complaints, and out-of-specifications (OOSs), ensuring consistent documentation and traceability from initiation to closure. Root cause analysis (RCA), corrective and preventive actions (CAPA), change controls (CC), document change requests (DCR), and effectiveness checks (EC) are fully integrated to drive effective resolution and continuous improvement.",
